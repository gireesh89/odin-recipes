        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>A dish consisting of chicken pieces that have been coated with seasoned flour or batter and pan-fried, deep fried, 
            pressure fried, or air fried. The breading adds a crisp coating or crust to the exterior of the chicken while retaining juices in the meat.</p>

                <li>½ cup seasoned bread crumbs</li>
                <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
                <li>½ cup milk</li>
                <li>1 egg</li>
                <li>4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves - pounded thin</li>
                <li>1 cup oil for frying, or as needed</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Steps to prepare</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>In a shallow dish, mix together the garlic powder, pepper, salt, paprika, bread crumbs and flour. In a separate dish, whisk together the milk and egg.

                <li>
                    Heat the oil in an electric skillet set to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Dip the chicken into the egg and milk, then dredge in the dry ingredients until evenly coated.

                <li>
                    Fry chicken in the hot oil for about 5 minutes per side, or until the chicken is cooked through and juices run clear. Remove from the oil with a slotted spatula, and serve.
